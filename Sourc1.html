        <p> Think back to the first time you had to consider how your career would change based on your visual problem. Or
        you might have been ready to enter college and needed to prepare yourself to achieve academic excellence in an
        environment designed for a visual world. Let's first lay some ground work that will later be important. Visual
        impairment affects each person differently. On the one end of the spectrum, some people are completely blind
        from birth. On the other end of the spectrum, some people may be in there 50's living with Low-Vision, 20/200
        which is the largest E on the standardized eye chart. For me, I have Retinitis Pigmentosa. So the visual acuity
        in my "good" eye is about 20/30 and 20/80 in my "bad" eye. However, in the periphery of my vision I'm totally
        blind in both eyes. When I think about my career, often my inner narrative goes something like this</p>


        <p style="font-style: italic">"I want to continue in my current career. My customer(s) are satisfied with my work, and I'm satisfied with the
        work I have delivered. I've worked very hard for many years to master the techniques used to deliver high
        quality tools and products. But alas, I've excelled at my career goals because (up until recently) I could see
        fairly well. All of my work is based on using a computer as I'm a software developer. In this sense my career
        world is entirely visual. I use specialized software that makes it possible to build software, so the typical
        use case of screen reading software geared toward reading emails and writing word documents probably will not
        cut it for me. How can I possibly make a transition from a visual computer experience of 20 plus years, to a
        non-visual auditory computer experience and still maintain the level of mastery and expertise I expect from
        myself?"</p>

        <p>I've tested several screen readers. Every time I try using them I get so frustrated after about 5 minutes of
        use. Frustrated NOT because I think it's bad or poorly designed software, but because transitioning to a
        non-visual way of working is a task that currently seems to difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear feedback from anyone who has A) Gone through something like this B) Is in the middle of something like this</p>
